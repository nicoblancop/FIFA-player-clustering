# FIFA-player-clustering
In this project I'm attempting to build a successful AI model to cluster FIFA 19 players in accordance to their FIFA data extracted from https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19.

You will find a jupyter notebook with the code i used and some comments.

To excecute it you will need to install via pip the required python modules and change the working directory to the one you'll use.
